# Part 1
---

In this part, we're going to create a **"Hello World"** **app** as the first step to our **Flask-Login project**. It will be structured as the following tree:

        .
        ├── Chapter_1
        │   ├── app
        │   │   ├── __init__.py
        │   │   ├── __pycache__
        │   │   │   ├── __init__.cpython-38.pyc
        │   │   │   └── routes.cpython-38.pyc
        │   │   └── routes.py
        │   ├── main.py
        │   └── Part_1.md

Our main application will be at the **app** folder, which will be the main repo with all necessary files to the **Flask** application. The **init.py** will be the initializer, with all needed modules to be working with Flask. The **routes.py** is guiding  the communication between front and back-end with the **endpoints** and **view functions**. Finally, the **main.py** is the file to run Flask server (***flask run***).
